# Core Concept of JavaScript


## Execution Context:
- Everything in JavaScript happens inside an execution context.
- You can assume that this execution context is a big box of containers in which the whole javascript code is executed.
- It has two components. ( 1.**Memory Component** , 2.**Code Component**)                                                                                  

| Memory Component       | Code Component    |
|------------------------|---------------|
| Here all variables and functions are stored as a key-value pair. <br/> Key:  value, <br/> A: 10, <br/>  Fn: {...}  | The whole code is executed one line at a time. |
| It is also known as the Variable Environment                                                                       | It is also known as the Thread of execution |
