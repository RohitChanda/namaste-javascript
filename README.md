# Core Concept of JavaScript


## Execution Context:
- Everything in JavaScript happens inside an execution context.
- You can assume that this execution context is a big box of containers in which the whole javascript code is executed.
- It has two components. ( 1.**Memory Component** , 2.**Code Component**)                                                                                  

| Memory Component       | Code Component    |
|------------------------|---------------|
| Here all variables and functions are stored as a key-value pair. <br/> Key:  value, <br/> A: 10, <br/>  Fn: {...}  | The whole code is executed one line at a time. |
| It is also known as the Variable Environment                                                                       | It is also known as the Thread of execution |


### How is this execution Context created?
```js
1.var n = 2;
2.function square(num) {
3.    var ans = num * num;
4.    return ans;
5.}
6.var sqaure2 = square(n); // function invoke
7.var sqaure3 = square(4); // function invoke
```
When the whole code is running behind the scenes a global execution context is created. It creates two phases.
- **Memory creation phase( 1st phase)**.
- **Code Execution phase(2nd phase)**.

#### call stack

- At the bottom of the stack, we have the Global Execution Context.
- Whenever a js program runs, the call stack is populated with a Global execution context.
- When a new execution context is created suppose e1, it is pushed into the stack.
- When e1 is done and returned, this e1 is moved out from the stack, and from the next line e2 is pushed into the call stack

Call Stack maintains the order of execution of the execution context.

The call stack is also known as â†’
- Execution Context stack
- Program Stack
- Control stack
- Runtime Stack
- Machine Stack

## Hoisting in JavaScript
Hoisting is a feature in JavaScript by which you can access variables and functions even before initializing it or putting some value in it. And you can access it without any error.
